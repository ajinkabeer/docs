When running a debug build of your app, you can access information, logs, 
and file issues to Amplify GitHub Issues directly from your application through the developer menu. 
By filing GitHub issues through the developer menu, critical information surrounding the issue is 
automatically added to the issue description, allowing Amplify community members to better assist 
you in resolving the issue.

The developer menu contains the following components:

* **Environment Information** - View versions of Amplify plugins used in your app and developer 
environment information.
* **Device Information** - View information about the device you are using to run your application.
* **Logs** - View and search the logs generated by Amplify loggers.
* **File a GitHub Issue** - After providing a description of your issue, an issue report is generated, 
which contains your issue description, environment information, and device information. 
Within the developer menu, you can copy this issue report or directly file an issue on GitHub, 
where the issue body will be pre-populated with the aforementioned information. When using the 
developer menu to file a GitHub issue, you will have an opportunity to review the issue information 
before filing the issue.
